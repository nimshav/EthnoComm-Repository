      <h3>Updated (and hopefully complete) ethnocomm bibliography</h3>

        <h4>Project Conventions and Production Standards</h2>
            <p>1) The bibliography is organized by year of publication from the top-down. Within each year, publications are organized by authors' names as accepted elswhere in the acadameia.</p>
            <p>2) At this inittal point, the project is written as a single html file due to my (dis)abilities as a programmer. Participants who wish to implement code that I do not know how to write can do so only if they are willing to commit to the production process in the longrun. Such              
                      individuals are welcome to contact me directly at: <a href="https://00806.net/?page_id=7">00806.net</a>.</p>       
            <p>3) The standard for coding an item in this project is the following:</p>
            <p>Line 1: Author name and year of publication.</p>
            <p>Line 2: Title of publication and a hyperlink to its content.</p>
            <p>Line 3: Publication venue and details.</p>
            <p>Line 4: DOI reference and a hyperlink to its content.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            
           ```
