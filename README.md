        <h4>Project Conventions and Production Standards</h2>
            <p>1) The bibliography is organized by year of publication from the top-down. Within each year, publications are organized by authors' names as accepted elswhere in the acadameia.</p>

Participants who wish to implement code that I do not know how to write can do so only if they are willing to commit to the production process in the longrun. Such              
                      individuals are welcome to contact me directly at: <a href="https://00806.net/?page_id=7">00806.net</a>.</p>       
            <p>3) In contrast with other programming conventions, the standard for coding an item in this project is the following:</p>
            <p>Line 1: Author/s and year of pblication.</p>
            <p>Line 2: Title of publication and a hyperlink to its content.</p>
            <p>Line 3: DOI reference and a hyperlink to its source content.</p>
