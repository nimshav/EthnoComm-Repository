      <h3>Updated (and hopefully complete) <a href="https://nimshav.github.io/EthnoComm-Repository/">EOC Bibliography</a></h3>
      <p><b>This is a first attempt to create a collaborative open source project within the academic area of the ethnography of communication (EOC). The project is dedicated to the construction and maintenance of an overall bibliography.</b></p>
      <p>The bibliography is provided <b>AS IS</b>, i.e., without any intentional attempt to explain, interpret or thematize the content materials. This is important as scholars might disagree about such issues. Hence, while the bibliogrphy can be variously used to make generalizations about the research program of the EOC, its presentation must remain as free from interpretation as possible. And while this statement itself entails a culturally specific moral position, it is the best one can commit to. By taking up this project, one does not (and should not) wish to appear as a spokesperson or interpretr of the field.</p>

      <p><h4>Project Conventions and Production Standards</h4></p>
      <p>A) The bibliography is organized by year of publication from the top-down. Within each year, publications are organized by authors' names as accepted elswhere in the acadameia.</p>
      <p>B) The project is written as a single html file due to my (dis)abilities as a programmer. Participants who wish to implement code that I do not know how to write can do so only if they are willing to commit to the production process. Such individuals are welcome to contact me directly at: <a href="https://00806.net/?page_id=7">00806.net</a>.</p>       
      <p>C) The html standard for encoding an item in this bibliogrphy is the following:</p>
      <p>Line 1: Author name and year of publication.</p>
      <p>Line 2: Title of publication and a hyperlink to its content.</p>
      <p>Line 3: Publication venue and details.</p>
      <p>Line 4: DOI reference and a hyperlink to its content.</p>
      <p>Example 1:</p>
      <pre>1. &lt;p&gt;Winchatz, M. R. (2018).</pre>
      <pre>2. &lt;a href=&quot;EOC_Library/Winchatz 2018 - The International Encyclopedia of Intercultural Communication.pdf&quot;&gt; Ethnography of cultural communication&lt;/a&gt;.</pre>
      <pre>3. In Carbaugh, Donal (Ed.), &lt;i&gt;Handbook of Communication in Cross-Cultural Perspective&lt;/i&gt; (pp. 65-75). Routledge.</pre>
      <pre>4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118783665.ieicc0120&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118783665.ieicc0120&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
      <p>D) The standard of naming a content file for the EOC_Library is the following: [AUTHOR] - [YEAR] - [SHORT TITLE with a sentence-case capitalization].pdf 
      <p>Example 2:</p>
      <pre>Carbaugh - 1988 - Comments on “culture” in communication inquiry.pdf</pre>    
      <p><h4>Rules for Inclusion</h4></p>
      <p>This project is aimed specifically at scholars working within the narrow area of the Ethnography of Communication (EC, EoC or EOC). Therefore, the bibliography will include only materials that directly apply, develop or test the following approaches: EOC in its Hymsean register; Speech Codes and Cultural Communication theory as developed by Gerry Philipsen and his collaborators; Cultural Discourse Analysis (CuDA) as developed by Donal Carbaugh and his collaborators; and Social Communication Theory as developed by Wendy Leeds-Hurwitz and her collaborators. The first iteration of the bibliography will only accept references that make their content materials accessible (ideally in the form of a pdf file as this is most stable).</p> 
      <p><h4>A Guide for Contributours who don't Know how to Use Git</h4></p>
      <p>At this preliminary point, please send me a zipped folder with the following files:</p>
      <p>1. A pdf file of your content, formatted as shown in example 2.</p>
      <p>2. A txt file that contains the publication's reference in the html format described in example 1 (if possible).</p> 
      <p><b>A more complete guide that explains how to report on and fix issues directly on Github, as well as to contribute code to the project will be published in the near future.</b><p>
