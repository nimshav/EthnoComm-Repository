      <h3>
         Updated (and hopefully complete) 
         <a href="https://nimshav.github.io/EthnoComm-Repository/">EOC Bibliography</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
         <b>This project represents a first attempt to create a collaborative open-source platform 
         dedicated to the academic study of the Ethnography of Communication (EOC). Its primary goal 
         is to construct and maintain a comprehensive bibliography.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
         The bibliography is provided <b>AS IS</b>—with no intentional effort to explain, interpret, 
         or thematize its content. While scholars may use it to derive general insights about the EOC 
         research program, the presentation strives to remain as free from interpretation as possible. 
         This commitment reflects a culturally specific ethical stance, chosen as the most viable option 
         to ensure neutrality. Participation in this project does not imply serving as a spokesperson 
         or interpreter for the field.
      </p>
      <p><i>A search engine and data visualization platform are currently under development!</i></p>

      <h4>Project Conventions and Production Standards</h4>
      <p>
         <b>A)</b> The bibliography is organized by year of publication in descending order. Within 
         each year, entries are sorted alphabetically by the authors' names, following academic conventions.
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>B)</b> The project is written as a single HTML file due to current programming constraints. 
         Participants who wish to contribute more advanced code may do so, provided they commit to the 
         production process. Interested contributors can contact me directly via: 
         <a href="https://00806.net/?page_id=7">00806.net</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>C)</b> The HTML standard for encoding bibliography entries is as follows:
         <br>Line 1: Author name and year of publication.
         <br>Line 2: Title of the publication (hyperlinked to the content).
         <br>Line 3: Publication venue and additional details.
         <br>Line 4: DOI reference (hyperlinked to its content).
      </p>

         <b>D)</b> The file naming convention for content in the EOC_Library is:
         <br>[AUTHOR] - [YEAR] - [SHORT TITLE with sentence-case capitalization].pdf

         For this first iteration, only materials with accessible content (ideally as stable PDF files) 
         will be accepted.
