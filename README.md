      <h3>Updated (and hopefully complete) ethnocomm bibliography</h3>
      <p><b>This is a first attempt to create a collaborative open source project within the academic area of the ethnography of communication (EOC). The project is dedicated to the construction and maintenance of an overall bibliography.</b></p>

      <p><h4>Project Conventions and Production Standards</h4></p>
      <p>A) The bibliography is organized by year of publication from the top-down. Within each year, publications are organized by authors' names as accepted elswhere in the acadameia.</p>
      <p>B) At this inittal point, the project is written as a single html file due to my (dis)abilities as a programmer. Participants who wish to implement code that I do not know how to write can do so only if they are willing to commit to the production process in the longrun. Such              
                 individuals are welcome to contact me directly at: <a href="https://00806.net/?page_id=7">00806.net</a>.</p>       
      <p>C) The html standard for coding an item in this bibliogrphy is the following:</p>
      <p>Line 1: Author name and year of publication.</p>
      <p>Line 2: Title of publication and a hyperlink to its content.</p>
      <p>Line 3: Publication venue and details.</p>
      <p>Line 4: DOI reference and a hyperlink to its content.</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>1. &lt;p&gt;Winchatz, M. R. (2018).</pre>
      <pre>2. &lt;a href=&quot;EOC_Library/Winchatz 2018 - The International Encyclopedia of Intercultural Communication.pdf&quot;&gt; Ethnography of cultural communication&lt;/a&gt;.</pre>
      <pre>3. In Carbaugh, Donal (Ed.), &lt;i&gt;Handbook of Communication in Cross-Cultural Perspective&lt;/i&gt; (pp. 65-75). Routledge.</pre>
      <pre>4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118783665.ieicc0120&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118783665.ieicc0120&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
      <p>D) The standard of naming a content file for the EOC_Library is the following: [AUTHOR] - [YEAR] - [SHORT TITLE with a sentence-case capitalization].pdf 
      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>Carbaugh - 1988 - Comments on “Culture” in Communication Inquiry.pdf</pre>    
      <p><h4>Rules for Inclusion</h4></p>
      <p>This project is aimed specifically at scholars working within the narrow area of the Ethnography of Communication (EC, EoC, EOC -- or what have you). Therefore, the bibliography will include only materials that directly apply, develop or test the following approaches: EOC in its Hymsean register; Speech Code and Cultural Communication theory as developed by Gerry Philipsen and his collaborators; Cultural Discourse Analysis (CuDA) as developed by Donal Carbaugh and his collaborators; and Social Communication Theory as developed by Wendy Leeds-Hurwitz and her collaborators. Additionally, the first iteration of the bibliography will only accept references that make their content materials accessible for the users in some way (ideally in the form of a pdf file as this is most stable).</p> 
      <p><h4>Guide for Contributours who don't Know how to Use GitHub</h4></p>
      <p>At this preliminary point, please create a zipped folder with the following files:</p>
      <p>1. A pdf file of your content, formatted as shown above.</p>
      <p>2. A txt file that contans the publication's reference, in the html format described above if possible.</p> 
      <p><b>A more complete guide that explains how to report on and fix issues directly on GitHub, as well as to contribute code to the project will be published in the near future.</b><p>
