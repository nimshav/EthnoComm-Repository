      	<h3>Updated (and hopefully complete) ethnocomm bibliography</h3>
      	<p>This is a first attempt to create a collaborative "open source" project within the academic area of the ethnography of communication (EOC). The project is dedicated to the construction and maintenance of an overall bibliography. A complete guide for participation in this endeavour will be published in the near future.</p>
